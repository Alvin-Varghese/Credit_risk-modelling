# Credit Risk Modelling

This notebook aims to determine probabilistically, whether a person will default on his loan in next 2 years. We use multiple modelling techniques and finally ensemble them to get at our predictions.
The current version of the model gives a fairly accurate score of 0.93552 with an ROC AUC of 0.86226.
